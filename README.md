# Ardunio-Morse-Code-Translator
Tap the button to enter morse code and the translation will be displayed on the LCD. The other button is used as a "space" key to seperate words.

Also keep in mind I was playing with the LCD so I added a smile and a heart character which I made a morse code for ("......" and ".....-" respectively). These can be ignored but my whole code design was changed to accomadate these special chars.
