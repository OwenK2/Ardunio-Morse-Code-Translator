# Ardunio-Morse-Code-Translator
A device that allows the user to tap morse code while the LCD displays the translation.

Simply create the circut and upload the code and it should work perfectly.

I made the schematic pretty quickly so I hope there is no mistakes.

Also keep in mind I was playing with the LCD so I added a smile and a heart character which I made a morse code for ("......" and ".....-" respectively). These can be ignored but my whole code design was changed to accomadate these special chars.
